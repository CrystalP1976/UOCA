The "Admin" page on this APP, is for logging race times that are officially timed by a Teacher, Supervisor or Administrator.

If you are a Teacher, Supervisor or Administrator from a school or another facility, and you'd like the password information, so you can log official race times (example: a gym teacher, or if you're hosting a special event), please email theathcote@gmail.com.

The yellow star shown on the Leaderboard, beside a racers name, indicates that it's an "official" race time (timed by a Teacher, Supervisor or Administrator).

Racers, if you're logging your own race times, please log accurate times!

If you have any comments, questions or concerns with this APP, please email theathcote@gmail.com.
